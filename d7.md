# D.7 V&V

## Description
> * Gif Machine is an online application that will give users a personal meme viewing experience that is tailored to them. 
The value of the application is giving users that personal aspect along with providing convenience. 
With GifMachine, people can log into their accounts. Each account will have their preference in gifs, along with their email address and password. 
Accounts will store preferences based on a series of questions, each one having multiple choices. The user can reset their preferences by simply 
answering the questions again. The gifs will appear sequentially, almost like TikTok shows videos. Instead, we will pull gifs from other sources 
that store gifs, such as Giphy. This means that gifs will instead be stored with a source URL and users can click on that to access the original gif.

## Verification (tests)

### Unit test
> Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.): We used unittest for our automated unit testing.
> * Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located: [Link](https://github.com/BaileyMcCauslin/CS386-Group-Project/tree/testing)

> An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
> * One test case that uses mock objects is testing if our ML model actually does categorical conversions using one hot encoding and returns the results as a pandas DataFrame.
> * Class: [Link](https://github.com/BaileyMcCauslin/CS386-Group-Project/blob/testing/predictions.py)
> * Test: [Link](https://github.com/BaileyMcCauslin/CS386-Group-Project/blob/testing/testing.py)

> A print screen showing the result of the unit tests execution.
