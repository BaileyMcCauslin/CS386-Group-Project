1. Positioning
  * Problem statement:
  The problem of inefficient media procurement affects many college students; the impact of which is that many people spend a very large amount of time        looking at gifs and Memes that they do not like, just so they can find one they do like.

  * Product Position Statement:
  For college students who like to use gifs and Memes, GifMachine is a image procurement app that uses machine learning to figure out what category of media a user wants, and supplies it to them without the need for the user to navigate through search bars and large lists of results; unlike Giphy, our product does not rely on users entering keywords to find gifs, and helps them find what they are looking for when they do not know exactly what they want.

  * Value proposition:
  Gifmachine is an image procurement app that allows college students to find gifs and memes to find gifs and memes more efficiently, providing them with gifs and memes that they want without forcing them to scroll through long lists of images.
  
  * Consumer segment: College students who often send gifs and memes through messages and social media.

2. Stakeholders

  * College Students: College students often use gifs and memes in social media conversations, so they want to find and send gifs and memes quickly.
  * Developers: Develop the application, from the machine learning model to the front-end website. The developers may also use the application, serve as testers, work on debugging, and even manage the project.
  * Competitors: Our main competitor is Giphy, as that is the most commonly used site for getting gifs at the moment. The integrated gif keyboard that is provided by iMessage also serves as competition.
  * Testers: Testers will be college students who are given early access to our product. Their job is to try to break out product, provide feedback on their results, and use the product before others. Their feedback will be crucial to see what works and what does not before our launch.
