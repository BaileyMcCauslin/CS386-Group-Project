# CS386 Group Project (Group 3)

# Gifmachine
Gifmachine is a website that provides users with gifs for their viewing pleasure. Gifs can also be shared with others so that our users can keep up in the
fast paced conversations they have on social media. Gifmachine personalizes the user's experience through a machine learning algorithm that is trained
using a survey that the user can fill out at their leisure. 

# Getting Started
### Prerequisites
All of the prerequisites needed for the JavaScript backend are contained in the prerequisites.json file. To install the prerequisites needed for the Python backend, use:
```pip install sklearn pickle-mixin pandas```.
For this site, we used Node.js. To install Node.js, see https://nodejs.dev/download/.


### Installing
To make sure everything is correctly installed, change into the cloned repo and run ```npm start```. This should install any prerequisites required by the JavaScript backend.

### Built With
> * [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework we used
> * [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - The machine learning library we used
> * [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Our relational database
> * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - The data manipulation library used
> * [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) - The module we used to save the ML model

### Running the Tests
To run automated tests, clone this repository. Then run ```git fetch && git switch testing```. This should put you in the testing branch. Then all you have to do is run ```python -m unittest```.

### Deployment
The easiest way to deploy this application is using AWS. Simply get an EC2 server, [set up Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html), install python dependencies, and run ```npm start```.
