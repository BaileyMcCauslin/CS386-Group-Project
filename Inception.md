*Date: 09-16-2022*  
*Group Members: Andrew Usvat, Bailey McCauslin, Cody Beck, and Nick Henderson*  

## Introduction
> Gif Machine project is a website that hosts a machine learning algorithm that generates memes(jokes) based on a survey provided to the user. When accessing the website, a user will have the option to take the survey or by default view a list of memes that are “trending”. The website will include a very smooth UI and provide a brief description of the project that guides users on the main page. Users also have an option to sign in and save their joke preferences from whenever they come back to the website.

## Initial value proposition and customer segments
> Gif Machine is an online application that will provide the users with memes in a manner that more accurately matches their tastes than any other meme procurement site. Our customer segment consists of young people who use social media often. These people will most likely be Gen Z’ers and millennials who often want to send memes and gifs to their friends.
