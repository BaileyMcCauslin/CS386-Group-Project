# Project Inception
*Group 3: "Gif Machine"*  
*Date: 09-16-2022*  
*Group Members: Andrew Usvat, Bailey McCauslin, Cody Beck, and Nick Henderson*  

## Introduction
> Gif Machine project is a website that hosts a machine learning algorithm that generates memes(jokes) based on a survey provided to the user. When accessing the website, a user will have the option to take the survey or by default view a list of memes that are “trending”. The website will include a very smooth UI and provide a brief description of the project that guides users on the main page. Users also have an option to sign in and save their joke preferences from whenever they come back to the website.

## Initial value proposition and customer segments
> Gif Machine is an online application that will provide the users with memes in a manner that more accurately matches their tastes than any other meme procurement site. Our customer segment consists of young people who use social media often. These people will most likely be Gen Z’ers and millennials who often want to send memes and gifs to their friends.

## Interviews summary

### Interview 1
1) **Interviewee:** 
> My roommate ( Lou )
 
2) **Interviewer(s):** 
> Andrew Usvat

3) **Date:**
> September 17, 2022

4) **Customer Segment:** 
>  Lou thought that the key part of the website was generally a good idea, he mentioned that this software is a lot like ifunny and other platforms that try and do the same thing. He mentioned that every type of meme (joke) site like this has an algorithm usually attached to it to get users to come back and enjoy the content provided for them. On the downside, sites like these will sometimes be hard to monetize and actually gather funds from users due to the fact that people are not willing to spend money on a monthly subscription. Rather users will either generally pay for ad free content or be bombarded by a couple aps which gives the creators compensation.

5) **Key insights from the interview:**
> * the main idea of the project is decent because there's not tons of competition
> * the idea of making money off the project is manageable but can be viewed as a downside.
> * the algorithm is what what will make the biggest differentiation across different meme platforms.

6) **Representative quotes:**
> * “I think that the platform could work but there is also already some competition out there”
> * “the algorithm is definitely will make your site unique, if it works correctly”
> * “generally I believe this should be viewed as more of project to provide the community with entertainment rather than actually owning an actual business and making  tons of money from it”.

7) **Assessment:**
> The interviewee sees the project as something that could potentially be nice to have as a website. He also mentioned that it is something that is obviously not a “Must have” as there is not a huge impact the project could have and that there are also other sites like this already.

### Interview 2
1) **Interviewee:**
> Josh ( A close friend )

2) **Interviewer(s):**
> Bailey
 
3) **Date:**
> September 20, 2022
 
4) **Customer Segment:**
> Josh is an avid meme lover. When asking about the things he doesn't like about existing meme applications, he brought up the fact that he always sees non-funny/not his style of content. He said he loved the idea of filtering out content based on what a user would like to see. He made the comaparison to following meme accounts on instagram and sometimes you see stuff you don't think is funny so a solution like ours would be useful. However, he said that he thinks in order for someone to make the switch, there must be better/more features then already existing meme applications. Overall, he said he likes the idea and would give it a try.

5) **Key insights from the interview:**
> * This confirms our hypothesis that the filtering is needed for meme applications.
> * We may need to add more features then we initally planned because Josh made the great point of switching platforms.

6) **Representative quotes:**
> * "Instagram meme accounts sometimes get on my nerves because they post insensative content and have a super broad range of posts. Very hit or miss for me."
> * "I think the idea of an app that can filter memes based on preference is a good idea but I think it will need other features in order for anyone to switch."

6) **Assessment:**
> In conclusion, our product would be labled as a nice to have product. It is a convience to have for a neich group of people like Josh. Josh gave me some great insight into confirming our hypothesis that other meme applications show the user content they don't want to see. He also made a good point that we may need more/better features than already existing applications in order for a user to switch to our application.
