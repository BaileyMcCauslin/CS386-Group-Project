# Gifmachine
Gifmachine is a website that provides users with gifs for their viewing pleasure. Gifs can also be shared with others so that our users can keep up in the
fast paced conversations they have on social media. Gifmachine personalizes the user's experience through a machine learning algorithm that is trained
using a survey that the user can fill out at their leisure. 

# Getting Started
### Prerequisites
All of the prerequisites needed for the JavaScript backend are contained in the prerequisites.json file. To install the prerequisites needed for the Python backend, use:
```pip install sklearn pickle-mixin pandas```.
For this site, we used Node.js. To install Node.js, see https://nodejs.dev/download/.


### Installing
To make sure everything is correctly installed, change into the cloned repo and run ```npm start```. This should install any prerequisites required by the JavaScript backend.
