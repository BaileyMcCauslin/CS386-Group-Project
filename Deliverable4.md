# 3. Tests

# 4. Adopted technologies
> React JS - We are using React as our web framework because it allows for dynamic components, state handling, and easy styling. It’s extremely easy to load in GIF’s dynamically and route to different pages.  

> Firebase/Firestore - Since we need to store little amounts of data, we chose to use firebase and firestore because of its easy user authentication and store small data in collections in firestore. Firebase is extremely easy to use with very little set up time without being overkill for our project. 

> Pandas - We are using Pandas dataframes to provide the inputs into the machine learning algorithm, as scikit-learn expects input in the form of a dataframe. We also used Pandas because Pandas dataframes are very easy to work with, as Pandas allows dataframes to be easily saved to and from .csv files.

> Scikit-learn - We chose scikit-learn over PyTorch and TensorFlow for its simplicity. Scikit-learn is really easy to use for simple machine learning problems. Seeing as we have are using a clustering model, which is super simple, it made more sense to just chose the simplest ML library. With scikit-learn, we are using the KMeans algorithm, as KMeans is a pretty simple and well used clustering algorithm. 

> Pickle - We used pickle to save the trained ML model. Using pickle you can save entire objects and open them in different .py files. This made our code lightweight as we did not have to retrain the algorithm every time we use. 

# 5. Learning/training

# 6. Deployment

# 7. Licensing
> We chose the MIT License. We chose this license for this permissibility. We liked that it allowed for many different uses, as we are all supporters of open source software. We also chose it because it provides no guarantees or warranties, and as this is student code, we do not want anyone to assume it to be perfect.
